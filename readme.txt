Netlify Test - 2/22/2023
github.com/jfashe
-----------------------

Greetings! My name is Josh, and this is my Netlify hosting test project! It's another simple website powered by html and css.
There are no real instructions to navigating this site, as it was just a cool project I was working on.
I discovered Netlify from a tiktoker. I'm not using my phone right now, but when I get on it I'll tag him and update this Readme!

Thank you!!
